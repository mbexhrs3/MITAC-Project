# MITAC (MITigating Aviation impact on Climate) Project

## Aim: 
The primary aim of the project is to improve the quantification of the climate impacts of aviation-induced contrail clouds and model the climate response to shifting night-time flight to day-time flights. 
## Objectives: 
i) Develop a new off-line model that quantifies the impact of contrails on the climate; ii) Characterise the radiative forcing of contrails during annual, seasonal and COVID-19 periods; iii) Identify the most suitable time and direction of flights to reduce aviationâ€™s impact on climate through Flight Scheduling Management. 

Shifting predominantly night-time flights to daytime has the potential to alter the radiation balance at the top of the atmosphere. This variation of net radiation depends on absorption and reflection of radiation by night-time and day-time contrails, which exerts a warming or cooling impact on climate. Assuming everything else remains the same, the nocturnal climate has favourable atmospheric conditions for contrail formation, due to its average cooler temperatures. Key to this research is that the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly limited air traffic movements across the world, and thereby offers a unique period of data to provide new insights into the non-CO2 impacts of aviation on climate. A machine learning technique will be applied to quantify the impacts of aviation on climate.
